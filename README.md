## ðŸš€ About Me
I've been learning about development for several years now.
I started 4-5 years ago with [Skript-Language]([https://skript.com](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript)) which allowed me to create my own Minecraft server.
It was in December 2022 that I finally decided to take up Java.
In September 2023, I decided to create my first plugin, which I would make public and open source, [MagicSniper](https://github.com/SniperTVmc/MagicSniper).
In addition to developing largely in Java, I also develop, for myself and my studies, in Python, lightly in HTML, and lightly in CSS.
In the next few months, I plan to launch into several new languages, C#, JavaScript, and Lua.
